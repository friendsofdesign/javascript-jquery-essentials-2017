# The DOM

The DOM stands for "Document Object Model" it is a language independent
convention used as a representation of interacting objects for HTML and XML
documents. The DOM is build up of "Nodes" each representing elements in the
structure, these combine to form a tree view, regarded as the DOM tree.
JavaScript and JQuery allow us to manipulate the nodes in the DOM and in turn
the data associated with nodes can be manipulated.

The DOM's tree structure also allows developers to identify objects relating to
one another, these relationships are formed in the hierarchy of the DOM tree.
From a particular node in the tree, developers can access the ancestors and
descendants of the node, often referred to as parents and grandparents or
children and grandchildren.

Lowest point or base point in the DOM tree is the `<!DOCTYPE html>` from there
everything will branch out like family tree. This would be the base ancestor for
all other elements in the DOM tree, making all other elements descendants for
the `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
